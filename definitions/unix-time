Unix time
=========
Unix time (also known as POSIX time or erroneously as Epoch time) is a system for describing instants in time,
defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970,
not counting leap seconds. 
It is used widely in Unix-like and many other operating systems and file formats.
